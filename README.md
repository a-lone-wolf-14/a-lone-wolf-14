- âš¡ Fun fact: Suppose you are in the middle of the day (in daylight), and the Sun suddenly vanishes (no impact at all, no residue, just gone!) then we will know it 8 minutes 20 seconds later both in terms of light                 and revolution of Earth around Sun, means that the moment the Sun vanishes we will still be experiencing the same light of the vanished Sun and the Earth will stll be revolving around the vanished                   Sun for around 8 minutes and 20 seconds.
